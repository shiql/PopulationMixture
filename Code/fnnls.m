function [x,w] = fnnls(XtX,Xty,tol)
%
%	x = fnnls(XtX,Xty) returns the vector X that solves x = pinv(XtX)*Xty
%	in a least squares sense, subject to x >= 0.
%	Differently stated it solves the problem min ||y - Xx|| if
%	XtX = X'*X and Xty = X'*y.
%
%	A default tolerance of TOL = MAX(SIZE(XtX)) * NORM(XtX,1) * EPS
%	is used for deciding when elements of x are less than zero.
%	This can be overridden with x = fnnls(XtX,Xty,TOL).
%
%	[x,w] = fnnls(XtX,Xty) also returns dual vector w where
%	w(i) < 0 where x(i) = 0 and w(i) = 0 where x(i) > 0.
